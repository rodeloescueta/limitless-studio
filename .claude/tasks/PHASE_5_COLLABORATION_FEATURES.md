# Phase 5: Collaboration Features

## Overview
Build comprehensive team collaboration tools on top of the established Kanban structure. This phase transforms the Content Reach Hub from a basic project management tool into a full collaboration platform with comments, file attachments, user assignments, and Slack integration.

## 🎯 **Phase 5 Goals**
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Status**: 🟡 **READY TO START**

Transform individual card management into collaborative team workflows with:
- **Rich Comments System** with @mentions and threading
- **File Upload System** supporting PDFs, images, and documents
- **User Assignments & Notifications** for task ownership
- **Slack Integration** for workflow notifications
- **Enhanced Team Collaboration** across content cards
