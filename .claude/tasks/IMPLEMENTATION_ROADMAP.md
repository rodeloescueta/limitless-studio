**Timeline**: Completed October 3, 2025
**Dependencies**: User Management List Page ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Fixed 404 error when clicking "Edit" button on users page

### **Problem Statement**

**Before Implementation**:
- ❌ Clicking "Edit" on `/dashboard/users` navigated to `/dashboard/users/[userId]` → **404 Error**
- ❌ No edit page existed for individual users
- ❌ No API endpoints to update user details
- ❌ Admin could not modify user information (firstName, lastName, email, role)

**After Implementation**:
- ✅ Edit page loads successfully at `/dashboard/users/[userId]`
- ✅ Full CRUD API endpoints for user management
- ✅ Admin can update all user fields with validation
- ✅ Protection against system lockout (self-edit restrictions)

### **✅ COMPLETED Components**
