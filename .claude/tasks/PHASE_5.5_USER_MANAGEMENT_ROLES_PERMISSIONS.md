## 🏗️ **Business Requirements Alignment**

### **Original Role Specifications**
From `docs/Limitless Studio System - APP.md`:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Admin / Manager** | Oversees all operations, reviews performance | Full access |
| **Strategist** | Approves scripts, edits, and final videos | Approve, comment, reassign |
| **Scriptwriter** | Writes and revises scripts | Access Research + Envision |
| **Editor / Designer** | Edits videos, designs thumbnails | Access Assemble + Connect |
| **Coordinator** | Orchestrates end-to-end workflow, manages handoffs between stages, ensures timeline adherence. Publishes content, attaches live links, tracks data | Research/Envision/Assemble: Read-only (can see progress, cannot edit) - Connect/Hone: Full access (manage publishing, analytics) - Global: Can reassign tasks, send reminders, update timelines |

**Note**: Skipping AI System and Client roles for Phase 5.5 (will be added in Phase 6)

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Database Schema & Authentication (4-6 hours)**

#### **1.1 Extend User Role System**
```sql
-- Update user role enum
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE 'strategist';
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE 'scriptwriter';
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE 'editor';
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE 'coordinator';

-- Final enum: ['admin', 'member', 'client', 'strategist', 'scriptwriter', 'editor', 'coordinator']
```

#### **1.2 Create Test Users**
```typescript
// Test user accounts for each role
const testUsers = [
  { email: 'admin@test.local', role: 'admin', name: 'Admin Manager' },
  { email: 'strategist@test.local', role: 'strategist', name: 'Sarah Strategist' },
  { email: 'scriptwriter@test.local', role: 'scriptwriter', name: 'Sam Writer' },
  { email: 'editor@test.local', role: 'editor', name: 'Emma Editor' },
  { email: 'coordinator@test.local', role: 'coordinator', name: 'Chris Coordinator' }
]
```

#### **1.3 Update Authentication System**

  - Consider card stage and user role
  - Handle special cases (assignments, ownership)

canAssignUsers(user: User, targetStage: string): boolean
  - Check if user can assign others to specific stage
  - Role-based assignment restrictions
  - Global assignment permissions for coordinators/admins
```

#### **4.2 API Route Protection**
```typescript

  <EditCardButton />
</RoleGate>

// Conditional rendering based on permissions
{hasStageAccess(user.role, card.stage, 'comment') && (
  <CommentSection cardId={card.id} />
)}

// Assignment UI restrictions
{canAssignUsers(user, card.stage) && (
  <AssignmentPanel cardId={card.id} />
)}
```

### **Phase 5: CardDetailsModal Integration (2-3 hours)**

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Multi-User Testing Scenarios**

#### **Test User Workflows**
1. **Scriptwriter (Sam)**:
   - Can access Research and Envision stages only
   - Cannot see Assemble, Connect, or Hone stages
   - Can be assigned to cards in Research/Envision
   - Receives notifications for assignments and @mentions

2. **Editor (Emma)**:
   - Can access Assemble and Connect stages only
   - Cannot see Research, Envision, or Hone stages
   - Can edit cards and upload files in accessible stages
   - Receives assignment notifications

3. **Coordinator (Chris)**:
   - Read-only access to Research, Envision, Assemble
   - Full access to Connect and Hone stages
   - Can reassign cards between stages
   - Can view all cards but edit only in permitted stages

4. **Strategist (Sarah)**:
   - Can view all stages (comment/approve mode)
   - Cannot directly edit content
   - Can approve/reject cards and provide feedback
   - Can reassign cards to other users

5. **Admin (Manager)**:
   - Full access to all stages and functions
   - Can manage users and permissions
   - Can override any restrictions
   - Receives all system notifications

### **Permission Boundary Testing**

#### **Security Validation**
- Attempt to access restricted API endpoints with different user roles
- Verify UI elements hide/show correctly based on permissions
- Test direct URL navigation to restricted areas
- Validate assignment restrictions (can't assign users to inaccessible stages)

#### **Edge Cases**
- User role changes while logged in
- Card moves between stages with different permission sets
- Assignment conflicts (user assigned to inaccessible stage)
- Notification permissions and filtering

### **Collaboration Workflow Testing**

#### **End-to-End Scenarios**
1. **Content Creation Workflow**:
   - Scriptwriter creates card in Research
   - Coordinator moves to Envision for scripting
   - Editor takes over in Assemble for production
   - Strategist approves in Connect
   - Coordinator publishes and tracks in Hone

2. **Assignment and Handoff**:
   - Admin assigns Scriptwriter to new Research card
   - Scriptwriter completes work and notifies team
   - Coordinator reassigns to Editor for Assemble stage
   - Editor uploads files and marks complete
   - Strategist reviews and approves final content

3. **Notification Flow**:
   - @mentions trigger notifications to appropriate users
   - Assignment notifications reach correct team members
   - Due date reminders function properly
   - Read/unread status tracks correctly

## 🚧 **Implementation Notes**

### **MVP Approach Rationale**
- **Direct Database Notifications**: Faster implementation, immediate functionality
- **No Queue System Initially**: Reduces complexity while maintaining core value
- **Business Role Focus**: Addresses primary user needs without over-engineering
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Queue system architecture documented for Phase 5.6

### **Security Considerations**
- **Permission Validation**: Double-check permissions in both frontend and backend
- **Role Transition**: Handle role changes gracefully without security gaps
- **Assignment Security**: Validate all assignments respect stage access rules
- **Session Management**: Ensure role changes invalidate appropriate sessions

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Permission Caching**: Cache role permissions to avoid repeated calculations
- **Selective Data Loading**: Only load data user has permission to access
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimize database queries for role-based filtering
- **UI Lazy Loading**: Load assignment and notification data as needed

### **Future Scalability Considerations**
- **Queue System Integration**: Phase 5.6 will add Redis-based notification queue
- **Advanced Permissions**: Foundation ready for more granular permission system
- **Client Role Addition**: Phase 6 will add client role with approval workflows
